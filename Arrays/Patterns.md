Assumptions plays good !!. Assume everything works from 0 to i-1, so work to be done between i-1 to i ....Apply Logic!.

Lookup Patterns: 
    1. Two Sum -> Use Hashmap for lookup of complementary element and track the i. 


2 pointers:
    1. Sort [0,1,2] -> Apply Dutch National Flag Algo -> Techincally a 3 pointers with low, mid at 0, 0 and high at n-1. Work to be done between mid and high as arr from 0->low-1 has 0's, low-> mid-1 has 1's, mid -> high is not sorted, high+1 to n-1 has 2's


3. Prefix Sum: 
    1. Subarray sum equals K




3. Go though moore's vooting algo to find ele with > n/2 occurrence
