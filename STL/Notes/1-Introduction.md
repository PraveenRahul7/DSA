# Standard Template Library (STL)

C++ STL stands for the Standard Template Library.

It's a powerful set of C++ template classes providing general-purpose classes and functions implementing popular algorithms and data structures such as vectors, lists, stacks, queues, sets, maps, etc.

The STL encourages the use of generic programming and abstracts implementation details, enabling developers to write efficient and flexible code.

## Key Components

### Containers
STL containers provide various data structures like vectors, lists, stacks, queues, sets, maps, etc., to store and manipulate data efficiently.

### Iterators
STL iterators provide a way to traverse and manipulate elements within containers, enabling generic algorithms to work independently of the underlying container type.

### Algorithms
STL algorithms offer a collection of commonly used algorithms like sorting, searching, and manipulating elements in containers, allowing developers to write efficient and reusable code.

### Functors
STL functors, also known as function objects, are objects that can be called as if they were functions. They provide a way to encapsulate a function within an object, enabling flexibility and customization in algorithms and operations.

STL simplifies the development process by providing a rich set of tools and abstractions, allowing developers to focus on solving problems rather than reinventing the wheel.
