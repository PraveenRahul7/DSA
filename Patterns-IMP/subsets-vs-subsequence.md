Yes! Both **subsets** and **subsequences** have **\(2^n\)** possibilities for a given sequence of length **n**.  

### **1. Number of Subsets: \(2^n\)**
- Each element in a set has **two choices**: **either include it or exclude it**.  
- Since there are **n** elements, the total number of subsets is:  
  \[
  2^n
  \]
- This includes the **empty subset** `{}` and the **full set** itself.  

🔹 **Example:**  
For `{1, 2, 3}` → \(2^3 = 8\) subsets:  
✅ `{}`, `{1}`, `{2}`, `{3}`, `{1,2}`, `{1,3}`, `{2,3}`, `{1,2,3}`  

---

### **2. Number of Subsequences: \(2^n\)**
- A subsequence is formed by **choosing some elements while keeping their order**.  
- Each element has **two choices**:  
  - **Include** it.  
  - **Exclude** it.  
- Since there are **n** elements, the total number of subsequences is also:  
  \[
  2^n
  \]

🔹 **Example:**  
For `[1, 2, 3]` → \(2^3 = 8\) subsequences:  
✅ `[]`, `[1]`, `[2]`, `[3]`, `[1,2]`, `[1,3]`, `[2,3]`, `[1,2,3]`  

---

### **Key Difference:**
| Concept | Definition | Order Matters? | Example for `[1,2,3]` | Count |
|---------|------------|----------------|---------------------|--------|
| **Subset** | Any selection of elements | ❌ No | `{1,3}` ✅ `{3,1}` ✅ | \(2^n\) |
| **Subsequence** | Selection while keeping order | ✅ Yes | `[1,3]` ✅ `[3,1]` ❌ | \(2^n\) |

**So yes, both subsets and subsequences are \(2^n\), but subsequences must maintain order! 🚀**
